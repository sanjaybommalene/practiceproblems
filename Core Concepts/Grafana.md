# Grafana: From Introduction to Advanced Topics

## Introduction to Grafana

Grafana is an open-source analytics and interactive visualization web application. It provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources. Grafana is widely used for monitoring and observability.

**Key Features:**
- Customizable dashboards
- Support for multiple data sources (Prometheus, InfluxDB, MySQL, etc.)
- Alerting and notification system
- User authentication and permissions

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**
    - Download from [grafana.com](https://grafana.com/get).
    - Install via package manager or Docker.

2. **Basic Concepts**
    - **Dashboard:** Collection of panels arranged in a grid.
    - **Panel:** Visualization (graph, table, etc.) of a query.
    - **Data Source:** Backend database or service (e.g., Prometheus).

## Integrating Grafana with Prometheus

### 1. Setting Up Prometheus

- Install Prometheus and configure it to scrape metrics from your applications.
- Ensure Prometheus is running and accessible (default port: `9090`).

### 2. Adding Prometheus as a Data Source in Grafana

- Go to **Configuration > Data Sources** in Grafana.
- Click **Add data source** and select **Prometheus**.
- Enter the Prometheus server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:9090`).
- Click **Save & Test**.

### 3. Creating Dashboards with Prometheus Data

- Create a new dashboard.
- Add a panel and select **Prometheus** as the data source.
- Write PromQL queries to fetch metrics (e.g., `up`, `http_requests_total`).
- Choose visualization type (graph, gauge, table, etc.).

## Advanced Topics

### 1. Advanced Visualization

- Use transformations to manipulate data.
- Combine multiple queries in a single panel.
- Use variables for dynamic dashboards.

### 2. Alerting

- Set up alert rules on panels.
- Configure notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.).
- Manage alert states and silences.

### 3. Dashboard Provisioning

- Define dashboards as JSON or YAML files.
- Automate dashboard deployment using configuration management tools.

### 4. User Management and Permissions

- Integrate with LDAP, OAuth, or SAML for authentication.
- Set up teams and granular permissions for dashboards and data sources.

### 5. Plugins and Extensions
 
- Install community plugins for new visualizations and data sources.
- Develop custom plugins using Grafana Plugin SDK.

### 6. Performance and Scalability

- Optimize queries and dashboard refresh intervals.
- Use Grafana Enterprise features for high availability and clustering.
