### ✅ Kubernetes & DevOps Architect/Director-Level Interview Q\&A (50 Questions)

---

#### 1. How would you design a Kubernetes cluster for high availability across multiple zones or regions?

**Answer:** Use a regional cluster with nodes spread across 3 availability zones. Distribute control plane replicas, use topology spread constraints, anti-affinity rules, and leverage regional load balancers. For cross-region setups, deploy multiple clusters with global DNS or service mesh-based failover.

#### 2. What trade-offs do you consider between managed Kubernetes services vs. self-hosted clusters?

**Answer:** Managed services simplify ops, provide SLAs, and reduce overhead but limit customization. Self-hosted offers full control but increases maintenance. Choose managed for most use-cases unless strict customization or air-gapped environments are required.

#### 3. How do you manage thousands of microservices across multiple clusters?

**Answer:** Use centralized GitOps (ArgoCD), service mesh (Istio/Linkerd), cluster API/terraform for provisioning, and observability tooling. Enforce standards with Helm/Kustomize, enforce policy via OPA/Gatekeeper.

#### 4. What are your strategies for scaling in Kubernetes?

**Answer:** Horizontal (HPA/KEDA), vertical (VPA), cluster autoscaler or Karpenter, bin packing with resource requests/limits, node affinity, and workload prioritization.

#### 5. How do you manage multi-tenancy in Kubernetes?

**Answer:** Namespace isolation, resource quotas, RBAC, OPA policies, and network policies. Consider vClusters or dedicated clusters for strong isolation.

#### 6. What CI/CD pipeline design do you prefer for Kubernetes?

**Answer:** GitOps with ArgoCD/Flux, CI via Jenkins/GitHub Actions/GitLab. Helm or Kustomize for packaging. Image scanning, dry-run deployments, canary/blue-green rollout.

#### 7. How do you ensure safe rollbacks and zero-downtime deployments?

**Answer:** Use rolling updates, readiness probes, feature flags, progressive delivery (Argo Rollouts), and database migration handling. Rollbacks via ReplicaSets or GitOps.

#### 8. What’s your approach to GitOps? What tools have you used?

**Answer:** Git as the source of truth. Tools: ArgoCD, Flux, Argo Image Updater. Use environment overlays, branch-based promotion, auto-sync, and drift detection.

#### 9. How do you standardize Kubernetes deployments across teams?

**Answer:** Shared Helm charts/Kustomize bases, internal dev platforms (Backstage), CI/CD templates, policy as code (OPA), centralized documentation.

#### 10. How would you implement multi-environment pipelines in Kubernetes?

**Answer:** Separate clusters/namespaces, Kustomize/Helm overlays, Git branch model, promotion gates (manual approvals), ArgoCD apps per env.
