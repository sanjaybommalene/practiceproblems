### Apache Kafka: In-Depth Notes

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform designed for high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable processing of real-time data feeds. It is widely used for building data pipelines, streaming analytics, and event-driven architectures.

#### Core Concepts of Kafka

1. **Event/Message**: A record or unit of data in Kafka, consisting of a key, value, timestamp, and optional metadata. Events represent something that happened, e.g., a user click or a sensor reading.

2. **Topic**: A logical channel where messages are published and consumed. Topics are identified by names and act as a feed for data streams.

3. **Producer**: An application or process that publishes messages to a Kafka topic.
- **Producer Configurations:**
  - `acks`: Controls durability (`0`, `1`, `all`).
  - `batch.size`, `linger.ms`: Control batching for throughput.
  - `compression.type`: `none`, `gzip`, `snappy`, `lz4`, `zstd`.
  - `retries`, `retry.backoff.ms`: Control retry behavior.
4. **Consumer:** Reads records from topics. Consumers are grouped into consumer groups for scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Consumer Configurations:**
  - `group.id`: Consumer group identifier.
  - `auto.offset.reset`: What to do when there is no initial offset (`earliest`, `latest`).
  - `enable.auto.commit`: Whether offsets are committed automatically.
  - `max.poll.records`: Controls the maximum records returned in a single poll.

5. **Broker**: A Kafka server that stores data and serves clients. A Kafka cluster consists of multiple brokers for scalability and fault tolerance.

6. **Partition**: Topics are divided into partitions, which are the basic unit of parallelism and scalability in Kafka. Each partition is an ordered, immutable log of messages stored on a single broker.

7. **Consumer Group**: A group of consumers that work together to consume messages from a topic. Each partition is consumed by exactly one consumer in a group, enabling load balancing.

8. **Offset**: A unique identifier for each message within a partition. Consumers track offsets to know which messages they have processed.

9. **Replication**: Kafka replicates partitions across multiple brokers for fault tolerance. One broker acts as the leader for a partition, while others are followers.

10. **Zookeeper**: A distributed coordination service used by Kafka (in older versions) to manage metadata, broker coordination, and leader election. Newer versions use KRaft (Kafka Raft) to eliminate Zookeeper dependency.

11. **Log**: The physical storage of messages in a partition. Each partition’s log is a sequence of messages stored on disk, with an associated index for efficient access.

12. **Retention**: Kafka allows configuring retention policies for messages, either by time (e.g., 7 days) or size (e.g., 1 GB). Old messages are deleted once retention limits are reached.

13. **KRaft**: Kafka’s Raft-based consensus protocol, introduced to replace Zookeeper in Kafka 3.0+. It simplifies cluster management by embedding metadata handling within Kafka itself.

#### Kafka in Production: Integration and Best Practices

Kafka is typically integrated into production systems as a central event bus or data pipeline. Here’s how it’s commonly deployed and managed:

1. **Architecture**:
   - Kafka clusters are deployed across multiple servers (brokers) to ensure high availability and scalability.
   - Producers and consumers are integrated via client libraries (e.g., Java, Python, Go).
   - Kafka Connect is used for integrating with external systems like databases, file systems, or cloud services.
   - Kafka Streams or ksqlDB is used for real-time stream processing.

2. **Deployment**:
   - **Cloud**: Kafka is often deployed on managed services like Confluent Cloud, AWS MSK, or Azure Event Hubs. These simplify scaling and maintenance.
   - **On-Premises**: Deployed on Kubernetes or bare-metal servers with tools like Strimzi or Confluent Operator for automation.
   - **Monitoring**: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Confluent Control Center monitor cluster health, latency, and throughput.

3. **Security**:
   - **SSL/TLS**: Encrypts data in transit.
   - **SASL**: Authenticates clients (e.g., using Kerberos or SCRAM).
   - **ACLs**: Access control lists restrict topic access to authorized users.
   - **RBAC**: Role-based access control for fine-grained permissions.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Add brokers to scale horizontally.
   - Increase partitions for higher throughput (though this requires careful planning as partitions cannot be reduced).
   - Use consumer groups to scale consumption.

5. **High Availability**:
   - Configure replication factor (e.g., 3) to ensure data durability.
   - Set `min.insync.replicas` to control how many replicas must acknowledge a write for it to be considered successful.
   - Use rack awareness to distribute replicas across availability zones.

6. **Performance Tuning**:
   - Optimize producer batching (`batch.size`, `linger.ms`) for higher throughput.
   - Tune consumer fetch settings (`fetch.max.bytes`, `max.partition.fetch.bytes`) to balance latency and throughput.
   - Adjust `num.io.threads` and `num.network.threads` on brokers based on workload.

#### Indexing and Partitioning

1. **Partitioning**:
   - Partitions allow Kafka to scale by distributing data across brokers.
   - Each partition is an ordered log stored on a single broker, but replicas of the partition can exist on other brokers.
   - Messages are assigned to partitions based on:
     - **Key-based partitioning**: The message key is hashed (using a consistent hashing algorithm) to determine the partition.
     - **Round-robin**: If no key is provided, messages are distributed across partitions in a round-robin fashion.
   - **Best Practice**: Choose a key that ensures even distribution (e.g., user ID, transaction ID) to avoid hot partitions.

2. **Indexing**:
   - Kafka uses **log-structured storage** with two types of indexes per partition:
     - **Offset Index**: Maps offsets to physical positions in the log file. This allows efficient seeking to a specific offset.
     - **Time Index**: Maps timestamps to offsets, enabling time-based lookups.
   - Indexes are stored as files alongside the log segments (e.g., `00000000000000000000.index`, `00000000000000000000.timeindex`).
   - Log segments are split into fixed-size files (default 1 GB) to manage disk usage and improve performance.

3. **Log Compaction**:
   - Kafka supports log compaction for topics where only the latest message per key is needed (e.g., a database change log).
   - Compaction retains the latest message for each key and deletes older messages, reducing storage needs.
   - Configured via `log.cleanup.policy=compact`.

#### Example Configurations

Below are example configurations for a Kafka topic and a broker, wrapped in an artifact.


# Example Topic Configuration
# Create a topic with 3 partitions, replication factor of 3, and log compaction
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --topic my-topic \
  --partitions 3 \
  --replication-factor 3 \
  --config cleanup.policy=compact \
  --config min.insync.replicas=2 \
  --config retention.ms=604800000  # 7 days retention

# Example Broker Configuration (server.properties)
broker.id=0
listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9092,SSL://:9093
num.partitions=3
default.replication.factor=3
log.retention.hours=168
log.segment.bytes=1073741824  # 1 GB
num.io.threads=8
num.network.threads=3
zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181  # For Kafka versions < 3.0
# KRaft settings (Kafka 3.0+)
process.roles=broker,controller
controller.quorum.voters=1@localhost:9093,2@localhost:9094,3@localhost:9095


#### Troubleshooting Q&A

1. **Q: Why is my consumer lagging behind?**
   - **A**: Consumer lag occurs when a consumer cannot keep up with the rate of incoming messages.
     - **Check**: Use `kafka-consumer-groups.sh --describe` to monitor lag.
     - **Solutions**:
       - Increase the number of consumers in the consumer group.
       - Scale partitions (if possible, but requires topic reconfiguration).
       - Optimize consumer fetch settings (`fetch.max.bytes`, `max.partition.fetch.bytes`).
       - Check for slow processing logic in the consumer application.

2. **Q: Why are messages not being delivered to the expected partition?**
   - **A**: Partition assignment depends on the message key.
     - **Check**: Ensure the producer is sending messages with a consistent key for deterministic partitioning.
     - **Solution**: Use a meaningful key (e.g., user ID) and verify the key is not null (null keys use round-robin).

3. **Q: Why is my cluster running out of disk space?**
   - **A**: Kafka retains messages based on retention policies.
     - **Check**: Verify `log.retention.hours` or `log.retention.bytes` settings.
     - **Solutions**:
       - Reduce retention period/size.
       - Enable log compaction for eligible topics.
       - Add more brokers or increase disk capacity.

4. **Q: Why are some replicas out of sync?**
   - **A**: Out-of-sync replicas (OSR) occur when followers cannot replicate fast enough.
     - **Check**: Monitor `UnderReplicatedPartitions` metric.
     - **Solutions**:
       - Increase `replica.lag.time.max.ms` to allow more time for replication.
       - Check network latency or disk I/O bottlenecks on brokers.
       - Ensure `min.insync.replicas` is not too restrictive.

5. **Q: How do I handle a broker failure?**
   - **A**: Kafka’s replication ensures data availability.
     - **Check**: Use `kafka-topics.sh --describe` to verify leader re-election.
     - **Solutions**:
       - Ensure replication factor > 1 and replicas are distributed across brokers.
       - Restart the failed broker or replace it with a new one.
       - Use rack awareness to avoid single-point-of-failure zones.

## Troubleshooting Q&A

**Q: Why are my consumers lagging behind?**  
A: Check consumer group health, increase consumer parallelism, tune `max.poll.records`, and ensure brokers are not overloaded.

**Q: What causes "Leader Not Available" errors?**  
A: Partition leader may be down or Zookeeper/KRaft issues. Check broker status and cluster metadata.

**Q: How do I recover from unclean leader election?**  
A: Set `unclean.leader.election.enable=false` for safety, but may cause unavailability. Investigate broker failures and restore replicas.

**Q: Why are messages not being delivered in order?**  
A: Ordering is guaranteed only within a partition. Use keys to ensure related messages go to the same partition.

**Q: How do I increase throughput?**  
A: Increase partition count, tune producer/consumer configs, use compression, and optimize hardware.

**Q: How to handle schema evolution?**  
A: Use Schema Registry and set compatibility mode (`BACKWARD`, `FORWARD`, `FULL`).

**Q: What to do if disk usage is high?**  
A: Adjust retention policies (`retention.ms`, `retention.bytes`), add more brokers/disks, or archive old data.
