### Apache Kafka: In-Depth Notes

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform designed for high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable processing of real-time data feeds. It is widely used for building data pipelines, streaming analytics, and event-driven architectures.

#### Core Concepts of Kafka

1. **Event/Message**: A record or unit of data in Kafka, consisting of a key, value, timestamp, and optional metadata. Events represent something that happened, e.g., a user click or a sensor reading.

2. **Topic**: A logical channel where messages are published and consumed. Topics are identified by names and act as a feed for data streams.

3. **Producer**: An application or process that publishes messages to a Kafka topic.
- **Producer Configurations:**
  - `acks`: Controls durability (`0`, `1`, `all`).
  - `batch.size`, `linger.ms`: Control batching for throughput.
  - `compression.type`: `none`, `gzip`, `snappy`, `lz4`, `zstd`.
  - `retries`, `retry.backoff.ms`: Control retry behavior.
4. **Consumer:** Reads records from topics. Consumers are grouped into consumer groups for scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Consumer Configurations:**
  - `group.id`: Consumer group identifier.
  - `auto.offset.reset`: What to do when there is no initial offset (`earliest`, `latest`).
  - `enable.auto.commit`: Whether offsets are committed automatically.
  - `max.poll.records`: Controls the maximum records returned in a single poll.

5. **Broker**: A Kafka server that stores data and serves clients. A Kafka cluster consists of multiple brokers for scalability and fault tolerance.

6. **Partition**: Topics are divided into partitions, which are the basic unit of parallelism and scalability in Kafka. Each partition is an ordered, immutable log of messages stored on a single broker.

7. **Consumer Group**: A group of consumers that work together to consume messages from a topic. Each partition is consumed by exactly one consumer in a group, enabling load balancing.

8. **Offset**: A unique identifier for each message within a partition. Consumers track offsets to know which messages they have processed.

9. **Replication**: Kafka replicates partitions across multiple brokers for fault tolerance. One broker acts as the leader for a partition, while others are followers.

10. **Zookeeper**: A distributed coordination service used by Kafka (in older versions) to manage metadata, broker coordination, and leader election. Newer versions use KRaft (Kafka Raft) to eliminate Zookeeper dependency.

11. **Log**: The physical storage of messages in a partition. Each partition’s log is a sequence of messages stored on disk, with an associated index for efficient access.

12. **Retention**: Kafka allows configuring retention policies for messages, either by time (e.g., 7 days) or size (e.g., 1 GB). Old messages are deleted once retention limits are reached.

13. **KRaft**: Kafka’s Raft-based consensus protocol, introduced to replace Zookeeper in Kafka 3.0+. It simplifies cluster management by embedding metadata handling within Kafka itself.

#### Kafka in Production: Integration and Best Practices

Kafka is typically integrated into production systems as a central event bus or data pipeline. Here’s how it’s commonly deployed and managed:

1. **Architecture**:
   - Kafka clusters are deployed across multiple servers (brokers) to ensure high availability and scalability.
   - Producers and consumers are integrated via client libraries (e.g., Java, Python, Go).
   - Kafka Connect is used for integrating with external systems like databases, file systems, or cloud services.
   - Kafka Streams or ksqlDB is used for real-time stream processing.

2. **Deployment**:
   - **Cloud**: Kafka is often deployed on managed services like Confluent Cloud, AWS MSK, or Azure Event Hubs. These simplify scaling and maintenance.
   - **On-Premises**: Deployed on Kubernetes or bare-metal servers with tools like Strimzi or Confluent Operator for automation.
   - **Monitoring**: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Confluent Control Center monitor cluster health, latency, and throughput.

3. **Security**:
   - **SSL/TLS**: Encrypts data in transit.
   - **SASL**: Authenticates clients (e.g., using Kerberos or SCRAM).
   - **ACLs**: Access control lists restrict topic access to authorized users.
   - **RBAC**: Role-based access control for fine-grained permissions.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Add brokers to scale horizontally.
   - Increase partitions for higher throughput (though this requires careful planning as partitions cannot be reduced).
   - Use consumer groups to scale consumption.

5. **High Availability**:
   - Configure replication factor (e.g., 3) to ensure data durability.
   - Set `min.insync.replicas` to control how many replicas must acknowledge a write for it to be considered successful.
   - Use rack awareness to distribute replicas across availability zones.

6. **Performance Tuning**:
   - Optimize producer batching (`batch.size`, `linger.ms`) for higher throughput.
   - Tune consumer fetch settings (`fetch.max.bytes`, `max.partition.fetch.bytes`) to balance latency and throughput.
   - Adjust `num.io.threads` and `num.network.threads` on brokers based on workload.

#### Indexing and Partitioning

1. **Partitioning**:
   - Partitions allow Kafka to scale by distributing data across brokers.
   - Each partition is an ordered log stored on a single broker, but replicas of the partition can exist on other brokers.
   - Messages are assigned to partitions based on:
     - **Key-based partitioning**: The message key is hashed (using a consistent hashing algorithm) to determine the partition.
     - **Round-robin**: If no key is provided, messages are distributed across partitions in a round-robin fashion.
   - **Best Practice**: Choose a key that ensures even distribution (e.g., user ID, transaction ID) to avoid hot partitions.

2. **Indexing**:
   - Kafka uses **log-structured storage** with two types of indexes per partition:
     - **Offset Index**: Maps offsets to physical positions in the log file. This allows efficient seeking to a specific offset.
     - **Time Index**: Maps timestamps to offsets, enabling time-based lookups.
   - Indexes are stored as files alongside the log segments (e.g., `00000000000000000000.index`, `00000000000000000000.timeindex`).
   - Log segments are split into fixed-size files (default 1 GB) to manage disk usage and improve performance.

3. **Log Compaction**:
   - Kafka supports log compaction for topics where only the latest message per key is needed (e.g., a database change log).
   - Compaction retains the latest message for each key and deletes older messages, reducing storage needs.
   - Configured via `log.cleanup.policy=compact`.

#### Example Configurations

Below are example configurations for a Kafka topic and a broker, wrapped in an artifact.


# Example Topic Configuration
# Create a topic with 3 partitions, replication factor of 3, and log compaction
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --topic my-topic \
  --partitions 3 \
  --replication-factor 3 \
  --config cleanup.policy=compact \
  --config min.insync.replicas=2 \
  --config retention.ms=604800000  # 7 days retention

# Example Broker Configuration (server.properties)
broker.id=0
listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9092,SSL://:9093
num.partitions=3
default.replication.factor=3
log.retention.hours=168
log.segment.bytes=1073741824  # 1 GB
num.io.threads=8
num.network.threads=3
zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181  # For Kafka versions < 3.0
# KRaft settings (Kafka 3.0+)
process.roles=broker,controller
controller.quorum.voters=1@localhost:9093,2@localhost:9094,3@localhost:9095


#### Troubleshooting Q&A

1. **Q: Why is my consumer lagging behind?**
   - **A**: Consumer lag occurs when a consumer cannot keep up with the rate of incoming messages.
     - **Check**: Use `kafka-consumer-groups.sh --describe` to monitor lag.
     - **Solutions**:
       - Increase the number of consumers in the consumer group.
       - Scale partitions (if possible, but requires topic reconfiguration).
       - Optimize consumer fetch settings (`fetch.max.bytes`, `max.partition.fetch.bytes`).
       - Check for slow processing logic in the consumer application.

2. **Q: Why are messages not being delivered to the expected partition?**
   - **A**: Partition assignment depends on the message key.
     - **Check**: Ensure the producer is sending messages with a consistent key for deterministic partitioning.
     - **Solution**: Use a meaningful key (e.g., user ID) and verify the key is not null (null keys use round-robin).

3. **Q: Why is my cluster running out of disk space?**
   - **A**: Kafka retains messages based on retention policies.
     - **Check**: Verify `log.retention.hours` or `log.retention.bytes` settings.
     - **Solutions**:
       - Reduce retention period/size.
       - Enable log compaction for eligible topics.
       - Add more brokers or increase disk capacity.

4. **Q: Why are some replicas out of sync?**
   - **A**: Out-of-sync replicas (OSR) occur when followers cannot replicate fast enough.
     - **Check**: Monitor `UnderReplicatedPartitions` metric.
     - **Solutions**:
       - Increase `replica.lag.time.max.ms` to allow more time for replication.
       - Check network latency or disk I/O bottlenecks on brokers.
       - Ensure `min.insync.replicas` is not too restrictive.

5. **Q: How do I handle a broker failure?**
   - **A**: Kafka’s replication ensures data availability.
     - **Check**: Use `kafka-topics.sh --describe` to verify leader re-election.
     - **Solutions**:
       - Ensure replication factor > 1 and replicas are distributed across brokers.
       - Restart the failed broker or replace it with a new one.
       - Use rack awareness to avoid single-point-of-failure zones.

## Troubleshooting Q&A

**Q: Why are my consumers lagging behind?**  
A: Check consumer group health, increase consumer parallelism, tune `max.poll.records`, and ensure brokers are not overloaded.

**Q: What causes "Leader Not Available" errors?**  
A: Partition leader may be down or Zookeeper/KRaft issues. Check broker status and cluster metadata.

**Q: How do I recover from unclean leader election?**  
A: Set `unclean.leader.election.enable=false` for safety, but may cause unavailability. Investigate broker failures and restore replicas.

**Q: Why are messages not being delivered in order?**  
A: Ordering is guaranteed only within a partition. Use keys to ensure related messages go to the same partition.

**Q: How do I increase throughput?**  
A: Increase partition count, tune producer/consumer configs, use compression, and optimize hardware.

**Q: How to handle schema evolution?**  
A: Use Schema Registry and set compatibility mode (`BACKWARD`, `FORWARD`, `FULL`).

**Q: What to do if disk usage is high?**  
A: Adjust retention policies (`retention.ms`, `retention.bytes`), add more brokers/disks, or archive old data.

### Kafka Interview Questions and Answers

#### **1. What is Apache Kafka, and what are its primary use cases?**
**Q**: Can you explain what Apache Kafka is and where it’s commonly used?  
**A**: Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform for high-throughput, fault-tolerant, real-time data processing. It acts as a message broker, enabling decoupled data pipelines. Primary use cases include:
- **Log aggregation**: Collecting logs from servers (e.g., Netflix for monitoring).
- **Event streaming**: Powering event-driven microservices (e.g., Uber for ride events).
- **Real-time analytics**: Feeding data to systems like Elasticsearch (e.g., LinkedIn for user activity).
- **IoT data processing**: Handling sensor data (e.g., Tesla for telemetry).

---

#### **2. What are the core components of Kafka’s architecture?**
**Q**: Describe the main components of Kafka and their roles.  
**A**: Kafka’s architecture includes:
- **Brokers**: Servers that store and manage data in topics, forming a cluster.
- **Topics**: Logical feeds where messages are published, divided into partitions.
- **Partitions**: Ordered, immutable logs distributed across brokers for scalability.
- **Producers**: Applications that publish messages to topics.
- **Consumers**: Applications that subscribe to topics, often in consumer groups for parallel processing.
- **ZooKeeper**: Manages broker metadata and leader election (pre-KRaft mode).

---

#### **3. How does Kafka ensure fault tolerance?**
**Q**: Explain how Kafka handles failures to ensure data reliability.  
**A**: Kafka ensures fault tolerance through:
- **Replication**: Each partition has a leader and followers (replicas) across brokers. If the leader fails, a follower takes over.
- **Replication Factor**: Configures the number of replicas (e.g., `replication.factor=3`).
- **Acknowledgments**: Producers use `acks=all` to ensure all in-sync replicas confirm writes.
- **Consumer Offsets**: Stored in `__consumer_offsets` topic, allowing consumers to resume after failures.

---

#### **4. What is a Kafka topic, and how are partitions used?**
**Q**: Define a Kafka topic and explain the role of partitions.  
**A**: A topic is a category for messages, like a queue or log. Partitions:
- Divide a topic into ordered, immutable logs for scalability.
- Are distributed across brokers for parallel processing.
- Use keys to ensure messages with the same key (e.g., `user_id`) go to the same partition for ordering.
- Example: A `orders` topic with 3 partitions allows 3 consumers in a group to process orders concurrently.

---

#### **5. How does Kafka handle message ordering?**
**Q**: Does Kafka guarantee message ordering? If so, how?  
**A**: Kafka guarantees message ordering **within a partition**, not across partitions. Messages with the same key are sent to the same partition, preserving order. For global ordering, use a single partition (less scalable). Example: For user events `{user_id: 123, action: "login"}`, the producer hashes `user_id` to assign the same partition, ensuring login events are processed sequentially.

---

#### **6. What are consumer groups, and how do they work?**
**Q**: Explain consumer groups and their purpose in Kafka.  
**A**: Consumer groups allow multiple consumers to process messages from a topic in parallel. Each partition is assigned to one consumer in the group, enabling load balancing. Offsets are tracked per group, so each group gets its own view of the topic. Example: In a `logs` topic with 4 partitions, a consumer group with 2 consumers splits the partitions (2 per consumer) for faster processing.

---

#### **7. What is the difference between `acks=0`, `acks=1`, and `acks=all` in Kafka producers?**
**Q**: Describe the producer acknowledgment settings and their trade-offs.  
**A**:
- **`acks=0`**: No acknowledgment; fastest but risks data loss if the broker fails.
- **`acks=1`**: Leader acknowledges write; balances speed and reliability but risks loss if followers aren’t synced.
- **`acks=all`**: All in-sync replicas acknowledge; slowest but ensures no data loss (highest durability).
- Example: For critical financial transactions, use `acks=all`; for high-throughput logs, `acks=0` may suffice.

---

#### **8. How does Kafka integrate with NoSQL databases?**
**Q**: Explain how Kafka connects to NoSQL databases like MongoDB or Elasticsearch.  
**A**: Kafka integrates with NoSQL databases using **Kafka Connect**:
- **Source Connectors**: Stream data from databases (e.g., MongoDB change streams) to Kafka topics.
- **Sink Connectors**: Write data from Kafka topics to databases (e.g., Elasticsearch indices).
- Example: A MongoDB source connector monitors `orders` collection and publishes `{order_id": 123, "status": "placed"}` to an `orders` topic. An Elasticsearch sink connector indexes this data for search.
- Tools: Confluent’s MongoDB and Elasticsearch connectors.
- Configuration: Use JSON configs with `connection.uri`, `topics`, and `schema.registry.url`.

---

#### **9. What is Kafka Connect, and why is it useful?**
**Q**: Describe Kafka Connect and its role in data integration.  
**A**: Kafka Connect is a framework for streaming data between Kafka and external systems (e.g., databases, cloud services). It uses:
- **Source Connectors**: Import data into Kafka (e.g., from MySQL).
- **Sink Connectors**: Export data from Kafka (e.g., to S3).
- Benefits: Simplifies integration, supports scalability, and handles fault tolerance. Example: A JDBC source connector streams database changes to a Kafka topic for real-time analytics.

---

#### **10. How would you monitor a Kafka cluster?**
**Q**: What tools and metrics do you use to monitor Kafka?  
**A**: Monitor Kafka with:
- **Tools**: Prometheus (with JMX Exporter or Kafka Exporter), Grafana for dashboards, Confluent Control Center.
- **Metrics**:
  - Broker: `MessagesInPerSec`, `UnderReplicatedPartitions`.
  - Consumer: `ConsumerLag`, `RecordsConsumedRate`.
  - Topic: `BytesInPerSec`, `PartitionCount`.
- Example: Use JMX Exporter to expose broker metrics at `http://<broker>:8080/metrics`, scrape with Prometheus, and visualize lag in Grafana.
- Alerts: Set thresholds for high lag or under-replicated partitions.

---

#### **11. How do you integrate Kafka with Prometheus and Grafana?**
**Q**: Explain the steps to set up Kafka monitoring with Prometheus.  
**A**:
1. Deploy **JMX Exporter** as a Java agent on Kafka brokers (`-javaagent:jmx_prometheus_javaagent.jar`).
2. Optionally, use **Kafka Exporter** for topic/consumer metrics (`kafka_exporter --kafka.server=<broker>`).
3. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics (`scrape_configs` in `prometheus.yml`).
4. Add Prometheus as a Grafana data source and import Kafka dashboards (e.g., Grafana ID 7589).
- Example: Monitor `kafka_broker_MessagesInPerSec` to track throughput.
- Validation: Query Prometheus at `http://<prometheus>:9090`.

---

#### **12. How does Kafka integrate with the ELK Stack?**
**Q**: Describe how Kafka works with Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.  
**A**: Kafka acts as a buffer in an ELK logging pipeline:
1. **Filebeat** collects logs and sends them to a Kafka topic (e.g., `logs`).
2. **Logstash** consumes the topic, parses logs (e.g., with Grok filters), and sends them to Elasticsearch.
3. **Elasticsearch** indexes logs; **Kibana** visualizes them.
- Example: Filebeat sends Apache logs to `apache_logs` topic; Logstash parses `{clientip, timestamp}` and indexes in `logs-YYYY.MM.dd`.
- Config: Use `output.kafka` in Filebeat and `input.kafka` in Logstash.

---

#### **13. What is the role of ZooKeeper in Kafka, and what is KRaft?**
**Q**: Explain ZooKeeper’s purpose in Kafka and the significance of KRaft.  
**A**: **ZooKeeper** manages Kafka metadata (e.g., broker info, topic configs) and coordinates leader election. **KRaft** (Kafka Raft) is a ZooKeeper replacement introduced in Kafka 3.3, using a Raft-based consensus protocol for metadata management. Benefits of KRaft:
- Simplifies deployment (no external ZooKeeper).
- Improves scalability for large clusters.
- Example: In KRaft mode, brokers run a quorum controller for metadata, reducing operational complexity.

---

#### **14. How do you handle schema evolution in Kafka?**
**Q**: What is Schema Registry, and how does it manage schema changes?  
**A**: Confluent Schema Registry stores and manages schemas (e.g., Avro, JSON) for Kafka messages, ensuring producer-consumer compatibility. It supports:
- **Backward Compatibility**: Consumers can read old messages with new schemas.
- **Forward Compatibility**: Producers can write new messages readable by old consumers.
- Example: A producer evolves `{name: string}` to `{name: string, age: int}`; Schema Registry validates compatibility before publishing.

---

#### **15. What is Kafka Streams, and how does it differ from Kafka Connect?**
**Q**: Compare Kafka Streams and Kafka Connect.  
**A**: 
- **Kafka Streams**: A Java library for real-time stream processing (e.g., filtering, aggregating) within Kafka. It processes data directly on topics.
  - Example: Aggregate `{user_id: 123, purchase: 50}` to compute total purchases per user.
- **Kafka Connect**: A framework for integrating Kafka with external systems (e.g., databases) using connectors.
  - Example: Stream MySQL data to a Kafka topic.
- Difference: Streams is for processing; Connect is for integration.

---

#### **16. How do you troubleshoot high consumer lag in Kafka?**
**Q**: A consumer group has high lag. How do you diagnose and fix it?  
**A**:
1. **Diagnose**:
   - Check `ConsumerLag` metric in Prometheus/Grafana.
   - Verify consumer throughput (`RecordsConsumedRate`).
   - Inspect broker health (e.g., `UnderReplicatedPartitions`).
2. **Fix**:
   - Increase consumer instances in the group to process more partitions.
   - Scale topic partitions (note: requires rebalancing).
   - Optimize consumer code (e.g., increase `fetch.max.bytes`).
   - Check for slow downstream systems (e.g., database writes).
- Example: If lag is 1M messages, add consumers and tune `max.poll.records`.

---

#### **17. How would you design a Kafka-based system for real-time analytics?**
**Q**: Design a system to stream user events for real-time dashboards.  
**A**:
- **Architecture**:
  - Producers send user events `{user_id: 123, action: "click"}` to a `user_events` topic (10 partitions, replication factor=3).
  - Kafka Streams processes events for aggregation (e.g., clicks per minute).
  - Sink connector writes results to Elasticsearch.
  - Kibana visualizes dashboards.
- **Components**:
  - Kafka cluster (3 brokers), Schema Registry for Avro schemas.
  - Kubernetes for deploying connectors and Streams apps.
  - Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring lag and throughput.
- **Scalability**: Add partitions or brokers for higher throughput.

---

#### **18. What are the trade-offs of increasing partitions in a Kafka topic?**
**Q**: What happens when you increase the number of partitions, and what are the downsides?  
**A**:
- **Benefits**:
  - Increases parallelism (more consumers can process data).
  - Improves throughput by distributing load across brokers.
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Higher latency due to rebalancing and offset management.
  - Increased resource usage (e.g., file handles, memory).
  - Potential ordering issues if keys are misconfigured.
- Example: Increasing from 4 to 8 partitions requires consumer group rebalancing, which pauses processing temporarily.

---

#### **19. How do you ensure exactly-once semantics in Kafka?**
**Q**: Explain how Kafka achieves exactly-once delivery.  
**A**: Kafka supports exactly-once semantics (EOS) via:
- **Idempotent Producers**: Use `enable.idempotence=true` to deduplicate messages.
- **Transactional APIs**: Producers use transactions (`transactional.id`) to write to multiple topics atomically.
- **Consumer Configs**: Set `isolation.level=read_committed` to read only committed messages.
- Example: A producer writes `{order_id: 123}` to `orders` and `inventory` topics in a transaction; if it fails, no partial writes occur.

---

#### **20. How does Kafka compare to other messaging systems like RabbitMQ?**
**Q**: Compare Kafka with RabbitMQ in terms of features and use cases.  
**A**:
- **Kafka**:
  - Distributed, high-throughput, persistent log-based system.
  - Ideal for streaming, log aggregation, and big data (e.g., 1M messages/sec).
  - Example: Netflix uses Kafka for real-time event streaming.
- **RabbitMQ**:
  - Traditional queue-based system, lower throughput, better for task queues.
  - Ideal for low-latency, point-to-point messaging (e.g., order processing).
  - Example: E-commerce uses RabbitMQ for synchronous order tasks.
- **Key Difference**: Kafka retains data for replay; RabbitMQ deletes after delivery.

10 Scenario-Based Kafka Troubleshooting Questions and Answers
1. High Consumer Lag in a Critical Application
Q: Your team’s real-time analytics application shows a consumer lag of 1 million messages in a Kafka topic. How do you diagnose and fix this?A:  

Diagnose:
Use Prometheus/Grafana to check kafka_consumer_lag metric for the consumer group.
Verify consumer throughput with RecordsConsumedRate.
Check broker health: Look for UnderReplicatedPartitions or high CPU/memory usage (kafka_server_BrokerTopicMetrics_MessagesInPerSec).
Inspect consumer logs for errors (e.g., slow processing, exceptions).
Check downstream systems (e.g., Elasticsearch sink) for bottlenecks.


Fix:
Increase consumer instances in the group to parallelize processing (e.g., scale to 4 consumers for a 4-partition topic).
Tune consumer configs: Increase max.poll.records (e.g., to 1000) and fetch.max.bytes (e.g., to 50MB).
Optimize downstream processing (e.g., batch writes to Elasticsearch).
If needed, increase topic partitions (e.g., from 4 to 8) and rebalance, but note this may cause temporary downtime.


Example: For a user_events topic, scaling consumers from 2 to 4 reduced lag from 1M to 10K in 2 hours after tuning max.poll.records=1000.

2. Broker Crashes Repeatedly
Q: One Kafka broker in a 3-broker cluster keeps crashing with “OutOfMemoryError.” How do you troubleshoot and resolve this?A:  

Diagnose:
Check broker logs (server.log) for OutOfMemoryError details.
Monitor JVM metrics via JMX Exporter: Look at heap usage (java_lang_Memory_HeapMemoryUsage).
Verify partition distribution: Use kafka-topics.sh --describe to check if the broker hosts too many partitions.
Check message size and throughput (BytesInPerSec, BytesOutPerSec).


Fix:
Increase JVM heap size in kafka-server-start.sh (e.g., -Xmx4g -Xms4g).
Rebalance partitions using kafka-reassign-partitions.sh to distribute load evenly.
Tune log.retention.bytes or log.segment.bytes to reduce disk/memory pressure.
If large messages are the issue, reduce message.max.bytes (e.g., to 1MB) or compress messages (compression.type=gzip).


Example: A broker with 200 partitions crashed due to high heap usage. Reassigning 50 partitions and setting -Xmx6g stabilized it.

3. Producer Fails with “RecordTooLargeException”
Q: A producer fails to publish messages to a topic, throwing “RecordTooLargeException.” How do you resolve this?A:  

Diagnose:
Check producer logs for the exception and message size.
Verify broker config: message.max.bytes (default: 1MB).
Check topic-level config: max_message_bytes (via kafka-configs.sh --describe).


Fix:
Increase message.max.bytes on the broker (e.g., to 10MB) and max_message_bytes on the topic.kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --entity-type topics --entity-name my_topic --alter --add-config max_message_bytes=10485760


Update producer configs: Set max.request.size to match (e.g., 10MB).
Alternatively, compress messages (compression.type=snappy) or split large messages in the application.


Example: A producer sending 5MB JSON payloads failed. Setting message.max.bytes=10MB and enabling Snappy compression resolved it.

4. Consumer Stuck in “Rebalancing” State
Q: A consumer group is stuck in a rebalancing loop, unable to process messages. How do you troubleshoot?A:  

Diagnose:
Check consumer group status: kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --group my_group --describe.
Look for frequent rebalances in consumer logs (e.g., “Group rebalance triggered”).
Monitor max.poll.interval.ms violations (default: 5 minutes).
Check for network issues or consumer crashes using Prometheus (kafka_consumer_failure_rate).


Fix:
Increase max.poll.interval.ms (e.g., to 10 minutes) if processing is slow.
Tune session.timeout.ms and heartbeat.interval.ms (e.g., 30s and 10s) to stabilize group membership.
Ensure consumers are healthy (e.g., fix crashes, optimize code).
Use static membership (group.instance.id) to reduce rebalancing.


Example: A consumer group rebalanced every 2 minutes due to slow Elasticsearch writes. Setting max.poll.interval.ms=600000 fixed it.

5. Under-Replicated Partitions Detected
Q: Prometheus alerts show high UnderReplicatedPartitions on a Kafka cluster. How do you address this?A:  

Diagnose:
Run kafka-topics.sh --describe to identify under-replicated partitions.
Check broker logs for errors (e.g., disk I/O issues, network failures).
Monitor IsrShrinksPerSec and IsrExpandsPerSec in Prometheus.
Verify broker connectivity and disk space (df -h).


Fix:
Restart failed brokers if they’re down (kafka-server-start.sh).
Fix network issues (e.g., firewall blocking port 9092).
Increase replica.lag.time.max.ms (e.g., to 30s) if followers are slow to sync.
Reassign partitions to healthy brokers using kafka-reassign-partitions.sh.


Example: A broker’s disk was full, causing under-replicated partitions. Freeing disk space and reassigning partitions resolved it.

6. Kafka Connect Sink Connector Fails to Write to Elasticsearch
Q: A Kafka Connect sink connector fails to write to Elasticsearch, logging “Connection refused.” How do you troubleshoot?A:  

Diagnose:
Check connector logs in Kafka Connect (connect-distributed.log).
Verify Elasticsearch availability: curl http://localhost:9200.
Confirm connector config: connection.url, topics, and key.ignore.
Check network policies (e.g., firewall, VPC rules).


Fix:
Ensure Elasticsearch is running and accessible.
Update connection.url in the connector config (e.g., http://es-host:9200).
Increase errors.retry.timeout and errors.tolerance in the connector to handle transient failures.
Validate schema compatibility using Schema Registry.


Example: A misconfigured connection.url caused failures. Correcting it to http://es-cluster:9200 fixed the issue.

7. Messages Not Reaching Consumers
Q: A producer successfully sends messages to a topic, but consumers don’t receive them. What’s wrong?A:  

Diagnose:
Verify producer success: Check kafka-console-producer.sh or logs for errors.
Inspect topic: kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic my_topic --from-beginning.
Check consumer group offsets: kafka-consumer-groups.sh --describe --group my_group.
Confirm group.id and subscription in consumer configs.


Fix:
Reset offsets if consumers are reading from the wrong position (kafka-consumer-groups.sh --reset-offsets).
Ensure consumers subscribe to the correct topic (topics.regex or subscribe()).
Check auto.offset.reset (e.g., set to earliest for old messages).
Verify acks=all on the producer to ensure messages are committed.


Example: Consumers used the wrong group.id. Updating it to match the intended group fixed message delivery.

8. Slow Producer Performance
Q: A producer takes several seconds to publish messages to a high-throughput topic. How do you improve performance?A:  

Diagnose:
Monitor RecordQueueTimeAvg and RequestLatencyAvg via JMX Exporter.
Check producer configs: batch.size, linger.ms, compression.type.
Verify broker metrics: NetworkProcessorAvgIdlePercent, DiskUsage.


Fix:
Increase batch.size (e.g., to 64KB) to batch more messages.
Set linger.ms=5 to reduce latency by waiting for batches.
Enable compression (compression.type=snappy) to reduce message size.
Scale brokers or partitions if the cluster is overloaded.


Example: A producer with batch.size=16KB was slow. Setting batch.size=65536 and compression.type=snappy improved throughput by 50%.

9. Kafka Cluster Runs Out of Disk Space
Q: A Kafka cluster stops accepting messages due to “No space left on device” errors. How do you resolve this?A:  

Diagnose:
Check disk usage: df -h on each broker.
Verify log.retention.bytes and log.retention.hours in server.properties.
Inspect topic sizes: kafka-topics.sh --describe.


Fix:
Increase disk capacity or add new brokers.
Reduce retention settings (e.g., log.retention.hours=24, log.retention.bytes=10GB).
Delete old log segments: kafka-delete-records.sh for specific topics.
Enable compaction for topics with keys (log.cleanup.policy=compact).


Example: A logs topic consumed 500GB. Setting log.retention.hours=12 and enabling compaction freed 300GB.

10. ZooKeeper Connection Issues in a Kafka Cluster
Q: Kafka brokers log “ZooKeeper connection timeout” errors, and the cluster becomes unstable. How do you fix this?A:  

Diagnose:
Check ZooKeeper logs (zookeeper.out) for errors.
Verify ZooKeeper connectivity: telnet zookeeper:2181.
Monitor ZooKeeperDisconnectsPerSec in Prometheus.
Check zookeeper.connect in server.properties.


Fix:
Restart ZooKeeper if it’s down (zookeeper-server-start.sh).
Increase zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms (e.g., to 30s) in server.properties.
Fix network issues (e.g., firewall blocking port 2181).
Consider migrating to KRaft mode (Kafka 3.3+) to eliminate ZooKeeper dependency.


Example: A misconfigured firewall blocked port 2181. Opening it and setting zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms=30000 stabilized the cluster.


Interview Preparation Tips

Relevance to NVIDIA JD: These scenarios test debugging skills for distributed systems, critical for NVIDIA’s infrastructure role. Relate answers to AI/ML pipelines (e.g., streaming GPU telemetry data).
Practice Strategy:
Practice 3-5 scenarios aloud, timing yourself (3-4 minutes each).
Use real examples from your experience or hypothetical NVIDIA use cases (e.g., monitoring Kafka for AI training data).
Be ready to sketch architectures (e.g., Kafka with Elasticsearch) on a whiteboard.


Key Points to Highlight:
Use Prometheus/Grafana for metrics (Q1, Q5).
Leverage Kafka Connect for integrations (Q6).
Optimize performance with configs (Q8, Q9).


Interview Tip: If asked a troubleshooting question, clarify the scenario (e.g., “Is this a single broker or a cluster?”) and explain your steps systematically.
