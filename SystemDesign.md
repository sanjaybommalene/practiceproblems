### Notes on Preparation
- FAAMNG+ Expectations in India: Interviews focus on scalability, trade-offs, and communication. Amazon emphasizes leadership principles, Google tests deep database knowledge, and Meta/Netflix prioritize real-world problem-solving.[](https://www.tryexponent.com/blog/system-design-interview-guide)
- Approach: Use a structured framework like RESHADED (Requirements, Estimation, Scope, High-level design, APIs, Data model, Evaluation, Detailed design) to break down problems systematically.[](https://dev.to/fahimulhaq/cracking-amazon-system-design-interview-top-questions-and-answer-45i1)
- Key Concepts: Master scalability (horizontal vs. vertical), load balancing, caching, database design (SQL vs. NoSQL), sharding, CAP theorem, and microservices.[](https://www.interviewbit.com/system-design-interview-questions/)[](https://www.coursera.org/articles/system-design-interview-questions)
- Practice Tips: Study real-world architectures (e.g., Uber, Netflix), use mock interviews, and draw clear diagrams. Resources like Educative‚Äôs *Grokking the System Design Interview* and Gaurav Sen‚Äôs YouTube playlist are highly recommended.[](https://www.educative.io/blog/system-design-interview-questions)[](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/system-design/)
